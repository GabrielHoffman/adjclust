# adjclust

adjclust is a package that provides methods to perform adjacency-constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Adjacency-constrained hierarchical agglomerative clustering is hierarchical agglomerative clustering in which each observation is associated to a position, and the clustering is constrained so as only adjacent clusters are merged. It is a common method used widely in various application fields including ecology (Quaternary data) and bioinformatics (for instance in Genome Wide Association Studies).

<em> Version 0.4.0 of this package was initiated as a part of the [Google Summer of Code 2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4961904920363008) program.
